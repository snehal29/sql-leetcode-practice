-- LeetCode #178: Rank Scores
-- Difficulty: Medium
--
-- Problem:
-- Write a solution to find the rank of the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:
-- The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.
-- If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.
-- After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.
-- Return the result table ordered by score in descending order.
--
-- Approach:
-- dense_rank() becasue needed to provide the same rank when it tie and next should be keep next rank without skipping it
-- 
--
-- Pattern:
-- Dense_rank()
--
-- Solution:
SELECT
    score,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) as 'rank'
FROM scores;

---------------------
--Panda solution---
--- Approach: rank dense_rank , sort ascending= False and drop the id column which is not required in output
import pandas as pd

def order_scores(scores: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    scores['rank']= scores['score'].rank(method='dense', ascending=False)
    df = scores.drop('id',axis=1).sort_values(by='score',ascending=False)
    return df
